## Installation
This library is available on [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/mark-gerarts/auto-mapper-plus):

```bash
$ composer require "mark-gerarts/auto-mapper-plus"
```

If you're using Symfony, check out the [AutoMapper+ bundle](https://github.com/mark-gerarts/automapper-plus-bundle).

## Why?
When you need to transfer data from one object to another, you'll have to write 
a lot of boilerplate code. For example when using view models, CommandBus 
commands, working with API responses, etc.

Automapper+ helps you by automatically transferring properties from one object 
to another, **including private ones**. By default, properties with the same name
will be transferred. This can be overridden as you like.

## Example usage
Suppose you have a class Employee and an associated DTO.

```php
<?php

class Employee
{
    private $id;
    private $firstName;
    private $lastName;
    private $birthYear;
    
    public function __construct($id, $firstName, $lastName, $birthYear)
    {
        $this->id = $id;
        $this->firstName = $firstName;
        $this->lastName = $lastName;
        $this->birthYear = $birthYear;
    }

    public function getId()
    {
        return $this->id;
    }

    // And so on...
}

class EmployeeDto
{
    // While the properties are public for this example, we can map to private
    // or protected properties just the same.
    public $firstName;
    public $lastName;
    public $age;
}
```

The following snippet provides a quick overview on how the mapper can be 
configured and used:

```php
<?php

use AutoMapperPlus\Configuration\AutoMapperConfig;
use AutoMapperPlus\AutoMapper;

$config = new AutoMapperConfig();

// Simply registering the mapping is enough to convert properties with the same
// name. Custom actions can be registered for each individual property.
$config
    ->registerMapping(Employee::class, EmployeeDto::class)
    ->forMember('age', function (Employee $source) {
        return date('Y') - $source->getBirthYear();
    })
    ->reverseMap(); // Register the reverse mapping as well.
                            
$mapper = new AutoMapper($config);

// With this configuration we can start converting our objects.
$john = new Employee(10, "John", "Doe", 1980);
$dto = $mapper->map($john, EmployeeDto::class);

echo $dto->firstName; // => "John"
echo $dto->lastName; // => "Doe"
echo $dto->age; // => 37
```

## In depth

### Instantiating the AutoMapper
The AutoMapper has to be provided with an `AutoMapperConfig`, which holds the
registered mappings. This can be done in 2 ways:

**Passing it to the constructor:**
```php
<?php

use AutoMapperPlus\Configuration\AutoMapperConfig;
use AutoMapperPlus\AutoMapper;

$config = new AutoMapperConfig();
$config->registerMapping(Source::class, Destination::class);
$mapper = new AutoMapper($config);
```

**Using the static constructor:**
```php
<?php

$mapper = AutoMapper::initialize(function (AutoMapperConfig $config) {
    $config->registerMapping(Source::class, Destination::class);
    $config->registerMapping(AnotherSource::class, Destination::class);
    // ...
});
```

### Using the AutoMapper
Once configured, using the AutoMapper is pretty straightforward:

```php
<?php

$john = new Employee("John", "Doe", 1980);

// Map the source object to a new instance of the destination class.
$mapper->map($john, EmployeeDto::class);

// Mapping to an existing object is possible as well.
$mapper->mapToObject($john, new EmployeeDto());

// Map a collection using mapMultiple
$mapper->mapMultiple($employees, EmployeeDto::class);
```

### Registering mappings
Mappings are defined using the `AutoMapperConfig`'s `registerMapping()` method.
By default, every mapping has to be explicitly defined before you can use it.

A mapping is defined by providing the source class and the destination class.
The most basic definition would be as follows:

```php
<?php

$config->registerMapping(Employee::class, EmployeeDto::class);
```

This will allow objects of the `Employee` class to be mapped to `EmployeeDto`
instances. Since no extra configuration is provided, the mapping will only 
transfer properties with the same name.

#### Custom callbacks
With the `forMember()` method, you can specify what should happen for the given
property of the destination class. When you pass a callback to this method, the
return value will be used to set the property.

The callback receives the source object as argument.

```php
<?php

$config->registerMapping(Employee::class, EmployeeDto::class)
    ->forMember('fullName', function (Employee $source) {
        return $source->getFirstName() . ' ' . $source->getLastName();
    });
```

#### Operations
Behind the scenes, the callback in the previous example is wrapped in a 
`MapFrom` operation. Operations represent the action that should be performed
for the given property.

The following operations are provided:

| Name  | Explanation |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| MapFrom | Maps the property from the value returned from the provided callback. Gets passed the source object, an instance of the AutoMapper and optionally the [current context](#adding-context). |
| Ignore | Ignores the property. |
| MapTo | Maps the property to another class. Allows for [nested mappings](#dealing-with-nested-mappings). Supports both single values and collections. |
| FromProperty | Use this to explicitly state the source property name. |
| DefaultMappingOperation | Simply transfers the property, taking into account the provided naming conventions (if there are any). |
| SetTo | Always sets the property to the given value |

You can use them with the same `forMember()` method. The `Operation` class can
be used for clarity.

```php
<?php

$getName = function ($source, AutoMapperInterface $mapper) { return 'John'; };

$mapping->forMember('name', $getName);
// The above is a shortcut for the following:
$mapping->forMember('name', Operation::mapFrom($getName));
// Which in turn is equivalent to:
$mapping->forMember('name', new MapFrom($getName));

// Other examples:
// Ignore this property.
$mapping->forMember('id', Operation::ignore());
// Map this property to the given class.
$mapping->forMember('employee', Operation::mapTo(EmployeeDto::class));
// Explicitly state what the property name is of the source object.
$mapping->forMember('name', Operation::fromProperty('unconventially_named_property'));
// The `FromProperty` operation can be chained with `MapTo`, allowing a
// differently named property to be mapped to a class.
$mapping->forMember(
    'address',
    Operation::fromProperty('adres')->mapTo(Address::class)
);
// SetTo sets the property to the given value.
$mapping->forMember('type', Operation::setTo('employee'));

// An extended example showing you can access the mapper in `MapFrom`.
$getColorPalette = function(SimpleXMLElement $XMLElement, AutoMapperInterface $mapper) {
    /** @var SimpleXMLElement $palette */
    $palette = $XMLElement->xpath('/product/specification/palette/colour');
    return $mapper->mapMultiple($palette, Color::class);
};
$mapping->forMember('palette', $getColorPalette);
```

`MapTo` requires some extra explanation. Since lists and maps are the same data
structure in PHP (arrays), we can't reliably distinct between the two. `MapTo`
therefore accepts a second parameter, `$sourceIsObjectArray`, a boolean value
that indicates whether the source value should be interpreted as a collection,
or as an associative array representing an object. By default we assume a
collection or a single non-array value.

```php
<?php

// This assumes address is an object, or a collection of mappable
// objects if the source is an array/iterable.
$mapping->forMember('address', Operation::mapTo(Address::class));
// This is equivalent to:
$mapping->forMember('address', Operation::mapTo(Address::class, false));
// If you want to be very specific about the source being a collection, you
// can use `mapCollectionTo`. This is purely syntactic sugar; it is equivalent
// to the declarations above as well.
$mapping->forMember('addresses', Operation::mapCollectionTo(Address::class));

// On the other hand, if the source is an array that represents an object, you
// can use the following:
$mapping->forMember('address', Operation::mapTo(Address::class, true));
// Or nicer
$mapping->forMember('address', Operation::mapArrayTo(Address::class));
```

You can create your own operations by implementing the 
`MappingOperationInterface`. Take a look at the
[provided implementations](https://github.com/mark-gerarts/automapper-plus/tree/master/src/MappingOperation)
for some inspiration.

If you need to have the automapper available in your operation, you can
implement the `MapperAwareInterface`, and use the `MapperAwareTrait`. The
default `MapTo` and `MapFrom` operations use these.

#### Dealing with nested mappings
Nested mappings can be registered using the `MapTo` operation. Keep in mind that the mapping for the
child class has to be registered as well.

`MapTo` supports both single entities and collections.


```php
<?php

$config->createMapping(Child::class, ChildDto::class);
$config->createMapping(Parent::class, ParentDto::class)
    ->forMember('child', Operation::mapTo(ChildDto::class));
```

#### Handling object construction
You can specify how the new destination object will be constructed (this isn't
relevant if you use `mapToObject`). You can do this by registering a *factory
callback*. This callback will be passed both the source object and an instance
of the AutoMapper.

```php
<?php

$config->registerMapping(Source::class, Destination::class)
    ->beConstructedUsing(function (Source $source, AutoMapperInterface $mapper): Destination {
        return new Destination($source->getProperty());
    });
```

Another option is to skip the constructor all together. This can be set using
the options.

```php
<?php

// Either set it in the options:
$config->getOptions()->skipConstructor();
$mapper = new AutoMapper($config);

// Or set it on the mapping directly:
$config->registerMapping(Source::class, Destination::class)->skipConstructor();
```

#### ReverseMap
Since it is a common use case to map in both directions, the `reverseMap()`
method has been provided. This creates a new mapping in the alternate direction.

`reverseMap` will keep the registered naming conventions into account, if there
are any.

```php
<?php

// reverseMap() returns the new mapping, allowing to continue configuring the
// new mapping.
$config->registerMapping(Employee::class, EmployeeDto::class)
    ->reverseMap()
    ->forMember('id', Operation::ignore());

$config->hasMappingFor(Employee::class, EmployeeDto::class); // => True
$config->hasMappingFor(EmployeeDto::class, Employee::class); // => True
```

<!-- I feel this can be explained better. Any help appreciated! -->
**Note**: `reverseMap()` simply creates a completely new mapping in the reverse
direction, using the default options. However, every operation you defined with
`forMember` that implements the `Reversible` interface, gets defined for the new
mapping as well. Currently, only `fromProperty` supports being reversed.

To make things more clear, take a look at the following example:

```php
<?php

// Source class properties:         Destination class properties:
// - 'some_property',               - 'some_property'
// - 'some_alternative_property'    - 'some_other_property'
// - 'the_last_property'            - 'the_last_property'
//
$config->registerMapping(Source::class, Destination::class)
    ->forMember('some_property', Operation::ignore())
    ->forMember('some_other_property', Operation::fromProperty('some_alternative_property'))
    ->reverseMap();

// When mapping from Source to Destination, the following will happen:
// - some_property gets ignored
// - some_other_property gets mapped by using the value form some_alternative_property
// - the_last_property gets mapped because the names are equal.
//
// Now, when we go in the reverse direction things are different:
// - some_property gets mapped, because Ignore is not reversible
// - some_alternative_property gets mapped because FromProperty is reversible
// - the_last_property gets mapped as well
```

#### Copying a mapping
When defining different view models, it can occur that you have lots of similar
properties. For example, with a ListViewModel and a DetailViewModel. This means
that the mapping configuration will be similar as well.

For this reason, it is possible to copy a mapping. In practice this means that
all the options will be copied, and all the explicitly defined mapping
operations.

After copying the mapping, you're free to override operations or options on the
new mapping.

```php
<?php

$detailMapping = $config->registerMapping(Employee::class, EmployeeDetailView::class)
    // Define operations and options ...
    ->forMember('age', function () {
        return 20;
    });

// You can copy a mapping by passing source and destination class. This will
// search the config for the relevant mapping.
$listMapping = $config->registerMapping(Employee::class, EmployeeListView::class)
    ->copyFrom(Employee::class, EmployeeDetailView::class)
    // Alternatively, copy a mapping by passing it directly.
    // ->copyFromMapping($detailMapping)
    //
    // You can now go ahead and define new operations, or override existing
    // ones.
    ->forMember('name', Operation::ignore())
    ->skipConstructor();
```

### Automatic creation of mappings
When you're dealing with very simple mappings that don't require any
configuration, it can be quite cumbersome the register a mapping for each and
every mapping. For these cases it is possible to enable the automatic creation
of mappings:

```php
<?php

$config->getOptions()->createUnregisteredMappings();
```

With this configuration the mapper will generate a very basic mapping on the
fly instead of throwing an exception if the mapping is not configured.

### Resolving property names
Unless you define a specific way to fetch a value (e.g. `mapFrom`), the mapper
has to have a way to know which source property to map from. By default, it will
try to transfer data between properties of the same name. There are, however, a
few ways to alter this behaviour.

If a source property is [specifically defined](#explicitly-state-source-property)
(e.g. `FromProperty`), this will be used in all cases.

#### Naming conventions
You can specify the naming conventions followed by the source & destination 
classes. The mapper will take this into account when resolving names.

For example:

```php
<?php

use AutoMapperPlus\NameConverter\NamingConvention\CamelCaseNamingConvention;
use AutoMapperPlus\NameConverter\NamingConvention\SnakeCaseNamingConvention;

$config->registerMapping(CamelCaseSource::class, SnakeCaseDestination::class)
    ->withNamingConventions(
        new CamelCaseNamingConvention(), // The naming convention of the source class.
        new SnakeCaseNamingConvention() // The naming convention of the destination class.
    );

$source = new CamelCaseSource();
$source->propertyName = 'camel';

$result = $mapper->map($source, SnakeCaseDestination::class);
echo $result->property_name; // => "camel"
```

The following conventions are provided (more to come):
- CamelCaseNamingConvention
- PascalCaseNamingConvention
- SnakeCaseNamingConvention

You can implement your own by using the `NamingConventionInterface`.

#### Explicitly state source property
As mentioned earlier, the operation `FromProperty` allows you to explicitly
state what property of the source object should be used.

```php
<?php

$config->registerMapping(Source::class, Destination::class)
    ->forMember('id', Operation::fromProperty('identifier'));
```

You should read the previous snippet as follows: *"For the property named 'id'
on the destination object, use the value of the 'identifier' property of the
source object"*.

`FromProperty` is `Reversible`, meaning that when you apply `reverseMap()`,
AutoMapper will know how to map between the two properties. For more info, read
the [section about `reverseMap`](#reversemap).

#### Resolving names with a callback
Should naming conventions and explicitly stating property names not be 
sufficient, you can resort to a `CallbackNameResolver` (or implement your own
`NameResolverInterface`).

This `CallbackNameResolver` takes a callback as an argument, and will use this 
to transform property names.

```php
<?php

class Uppercase
{
    public $IMAPROPERTY;
}

class Lowercase
{
    public $imaproperty;
}

$uppercaseResolver = new CallbackNameResolver(function ($targetProperty) {
    return strtolower($targetProperty);
});

$config->registerMapping(Uppercase::class; Lowercase::class)
    ->withNameResolver($uppercaseResolver);

$uc = new Uppercase();
$uc->IMAPROPERTY = 'value';

$lc = $mapper->map($uc, Lowercase::class);
echo $lc->imaproperty; // => "value"
```

### The Options object
The `Options` object is a value object containing the possible options for both
the `AutoMapperConfig` and the `Mapping` instances.

The `Options` you set for the `AutoMapperConfig` will act as the default options
for every `Mapping` you register. These options can be overridden for every
mapping.

For example:

```php
<?php

$config = new AutoMapperConfig();
$config->getOptions()->setDefaultMappingOperation(Operation::ignore());

$defaultMapping = $config->registerMapping(Source::class, Destination::class);
$overriddenMapping = $config->registerMapping(AnotherSource::class, Destination::class)
    ->withDefaultOperation(new DefaultMappingOperation());

$defaultMapping->getOptions()->getDefaultMappingOperation(); // => Ignore
$overriddenMapping->getOptions()->getDefaultMappingOperation(); // => DefaultMappingOperation
```

The available options that can be set are:

| Name  | Default value | Comments |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Source naming convention | `null` | The naming convention of the source class (e.g. `CamelCaseNamingConversion`). Also see [naming conventions](#naming-conventions). |
| Destination naming convention | `null` | See above. |
| Skip constructor | `true` | whether or not the constructor should be skipped when instantiating a new class. Use `$options->skipConstructor()` and `$options->dontSkipConstructor()` to change. |
| Property accessor | `PropertyAccessor` | Use this to provide an alternative implementation of the property accessor. A property accessor combines the reading and writing of properties |
| Property reader | `PropertyAccessor` | Use this to provide an alternative implementation of the property reader. |
| Property writer | `PropertyAccessor` | Use this to provide an alternative implementation of the property writer. |
| Default mapping operation | `DefaultMappingOperation` | the default operation used when mapping a property. Also see [mapping operations](#operations) |
| Default name resolver | `NameResolver` | The default class to resolve property names |
| Custom Mapper | `null` | Grants the ability to use a [custom mapper](#using-a-custom-mapper). |
| Object crates | `[\stdClass::class]` | See [the dedicated section](#the-concept-of-object-crates). |
| Ignore null properties | false | Sets whether or not a source property should be mapped to the destination object if the source value is null |
| Use substitution | true | Whether or not the Liskov substitution principle should be applied when resolving a mapping. |
| createUnregisteredMappings | false | Whether or not an exception should be thrown for unregistered mappings, or a mapping should be generated on the fly. |

### Setting the options

#### For the AutoMapperConfig
You can set the options for the `AutoMapperConfig` by retrieving the object:

```php
<?php

$config = new AutoMapperConfig();
$config->getOptions()->dontSkipConstructor();
```

Alternatively, you can set the options by providing a callback to the 
constructor. The callback will be passed an instance of the default `Options`:

```php
<?php

// This will set the options for this specific mapping.
$config = new AutoMapperConfig(function (Options $options) {
    $options->dontSkipConstructor();
    $options->setDefaultMappingOperation(Operation::ignore());
    // ...
});
```

#### For the Mappings
A mapping also has the `getOptions` method available. However, chainable helper 
methods exist for more convenient overriding of the options:

```php
<?php

$config->registerMapping(Source::class, Destination::class)
    ->skipConstructor()
    ->withDefaultOperation(Operation::ignore());
```

Setting options via a callable has been provided for mappings as well, using the
`setDefaults()` method:

```php
<?php

$config->registerMapping(Source::class, Destination::class)
    ->setDefaults(function (Options $options) {
        $options->dontSkipConstructor();
        // ...
    });
```

### Mapping with stdClass
As a side note it is worth mentioning that it is possible to map from and to
`stdClass`. Mapping *from* `stdClass` happens as you would expect, copying
properties to the new object.

```php
<?php

// Register the mapping.
$config->registerMapping(\stdClass::class, Employee::class);
$mapper = new AutoMapper($config);

$employee = new \stdClass();
$employee->firstName = 'John';
$employee->lastName = 'Doe';

$result = $mapper->map($employee, Employee::class);
echo $result->firstName; // => "John"
echo $result->lastName; // => "Doe"
```

Mapping *to* `\stdClass` requires some explanation. All properties available on
the provided source object are copied to the `\stdClass` as public properties.
It's still possible to define operations for individual properties (for example,
to ignore a property).

```php
<?php

// Operations can still be registered.
$config->registerMapping(Employee::class, \stdClass::class)
    ->forMember('id', Operation::ignore());
$mapper = new AutoMapper($config);

$employee = new Employee(5, 'John', 'Doe', 1978);
$result = $mapper->map($employee, \stdClass::class);

echo $result->firstName; // => "John"
echo $result->lastName; // => "Doe"
var_dump(isset($result->id)); // => bool(false)
```

Naming conventions will be taken into account, so keep this in mind when
defining operations. The property name has to match the naming convention of the
target.

```php
<?php

$config->registerMapping(CamelCaseSource::class, \stdClass::class)
    ->withNamingConventions(
        new CamelCaseNamingConvention(),
        new SnakeCaseNamingConvention()
    )
    // Operations have to be defined using the target property name.
    ->forMember('some_property', function () { return 'new value'; });
$mapper = new AutoMapper($config);

$source = new CamelCaseSource();
$source->someProperty = 'original value';
$source->anotherProperty = 'Another value';
$result = $mapper->map($employee, \stdClass::class);

var_dump(isset($result->someProperty)); // => bool(false)
echo $result->some_property; // => "new value"
echo $result->another_property; // => "Another value"
```

### The concept of object crates
As suggested and explained in [this issue](https://github.com/mark-gerarts/automapper-plus/issues/3),
AutoMapper+ uses *object crates* to allow mapping to `\stdClass`. This means you
can register your own classes as well to be an object crate. This makes the
mapper handle it exactly as `\stdClass`, writing all source properties to public
properties on the target.

Registering object crates can be done using the `Options`.

```php
<?php

class YourObjectCrate { }

$config = new AutoMapperConfig(); // (Or pass a callable to the constructor)
$config->getOptions()->registerObjectCrate(YourObjectCrate::class);
$config->registerMapping(Employee::class, YourObjectCrate::class);
$mapper = new AutoMapper($config);

$employee = new Employee(5, 'John', 'Doe', 1978);
$result = $mapper->map($employee, YourObjectCrate::class);

echo $result->firstName; // => "John"
echo $result->lastName; // => "Doe"
echo get_class($result); // => "YourObjectCrate"
```

### Mapping with arrays
It is possible to map associative arrays into objects (shout-out to @slava-v).
This can be done just like you would declare a regular mapping:

```php
<?php

$config->registerMapping('array', Employee::class); // Alternatively, use the enum DataType::ARRAY
// Adding operations works just as you would expect.
$config->registerMapping(DataType::ARRAY, Employee::class)
    ->forMember('id', Operation::ignore())
    ->forMember('type', Operation::setTo('employee'))
    // Since arrays are oftentimes snake_case'd.
    ->withNamingConventions(
        new SnakeCaseNamingConvention(),
        new CamelCaseNamingConvention()
    );

// It is now possible to map an array to an employee:
$employee = [
    'id' => 5,
    'first_name' => 'John',
    'last_name' => 'Doe'
];
$result = $mapper->map($employee, Employee::class);
echo $result->firstName; // => "John"
echo $result->id; // => null
echo $result->type; // => "employee"
```

See the `MapTo` section under [Operations](#operations) for some more details
about the intricacies involving this operation in combination with arrays.

As for now, it is not possible to map *to* an array. While this is relatively
easy to implement, it would introduce a breaking change. It is part of version
2.x, so check there if you need this feature.

### Using a custom mapper
This library attempts to make registering mappings painless, with as little 
configuration as possible. However, cases exist where a mapping requires a lot
of custom code. This code would look a lot cleaner if put in its own class.
Another reason to resort to a custom mapper would be [performance](#performance).

It is therefore possible to specify a custom mapper class for a mapping. This
mapper has to implement the `DestinationMapperInterface`.

```php
<?php

class EmployeeMapper implements DestinationMapperInterface
{
    /**
     * @param Employee $source
     * @param EmployeeDto $destination
     * @return EmployeeDto
     */
    public function mapToObject($source, $destination)
    {
        $destination->id = $source->getId();
        $destination->firstName = $source->getFirstName();
        $destination->lastName = $source->getLastName();
        $destination->age = date('Y') - $source->getBirthYear();

        return $destination;
    }
}

$config->registerMapping(Employee::class, EmployeeDto::class)
    ->useCustomMapper(new EmployeeMapper());
$mapper = new AutoMapper($config);

// The AutoMapper can now be used as usual, but your custom mapper class will be
// called to do the actual mapping.
$employee = new Employee(10, 'John', 'Doe', 1980);
$result = $mapper->map($employee, EmployeeDto::class);
```

### Using middlewares
You can register middlewares to customize how automapper works internally and define
global behaviors.

The following example will set 42 to any `id` property that would have been `null`.

```php
<?php

class AnwserToUniverseMiddleware implements PropertyMiddleware
{
    public function mapProperty($propertyName,
                                $source,
                                $destination,
                                AutoMapperInterface $mapper,
                                MappingInterface $mapping,
                                MappingOperationInterface $operation,
                                array $context,
                                callable $next)
    {
        if ($propertyName === 'id') {
            $defaultValue = $mapping->getOptions()->getPropertyReader()->getProperty($destination, $propertyName);
            if ($defaultValue === NULL) {
                $mapping->getOptions()->getPropertyWriter()->setProperty($destination, $propertyName, 42);
            }
        }
        $next();
    }
}

$config->registerMiddlewares(new AnwserToUniverseMiddleware());
$config->registerMapping(Employee::class, EmployeeDto::class);
$mapper = new AutoMapper($config);

// The AutoMapper can now be used as usual, but your middleware will intercept some property mappings.
$employee = new Employee(NULL, 'John', 'Doe', 1980);
$result = $mapper->map($employee, EmployeeDto::class);
echo $result->id; // => 42
```

### Adding context
Sometimes a mapping should behave differently based on the context. It is
therefore possible to pass a third argument to the map methods to describe
the current context. Both the `MapFrom` and `MapTo` operations can make use of
this context to alter their behaviour.

The context argument is an array that can contain any arbitrary value. Note
that this argument isn't part of the `AutoMapperInterface` yet, since it would
break backwards compatibility. It will be added in the next major release.

```php
<?php

// This example shows how for example the current locale can be passed to alter
// the mapping behaviour.
$config->registerMapping(Employee::class, EmployeeDto::class)
    ->forMember(
        'honorific',
        function ($source, AutoMapperInterface $mapper, array $context): string {
            $translationKey = "honorific.{$source->getGender()}";
            return $this->translator->trans($translationKey, $context['locale']);
        }
    );

// Usage:
$mapper->map($employee, EmployeeDto::class, ['locale' => $request->getLocale()]);
```

When using the `mapToObject` method, the context will contain the destination
object by default. It is accessible using `$context[AutoMapper::DESTINATION_CONTEXT]`.
This is useful in scenarios where you need data from the destination object
to populate the object you're mapping.

When implementing a custom constructor, the context will contain the destination
class by default. It is accessible using `$context[AutoMapper::DESTINATION_CLASS_CONTEXT]`.

When mapping an object graph, the context will also contain arrays for property 
name paths, ancestor source objects and ancestor destination objects. Those arrays 
are accessible using `$context[AutoMapper::PROPERTY_STACK_CONTEXT]`, 
`$context[AutoMapper::SOURCE_STACK_CONTEXT]` and `$context[AutoMapper::DESTINATION_STACK_CONTEXT]`.
They can be used to implement custom mapping function based on the hierarchy level and current position
inside the object graph being mapped.

### Misc

- Passing `NULL` as an argument for the source object to `map` returns `NULL`.

## Similar libraries
When picking a library, it's important to see what options are available. No
library is perfect, and they all have their pro's and con's.

A few other object mappers exist for PHP. They're listed here with a short
description, and are definitely worth checking out!

- **[Jane automapper](https://github.com/janephp/automapper):**
    - Similar API
    - Compiles mappings, resulting in near-native performance
- **[Nylle/PHP-AutoMapper](https://github.com/Nylle/PHP-AutoMapper):**
    - Only maps public properties
    - Requires some conventions to be met
    - Does some interesting stuff with types
- **[Papper](https://github.com/idr0id/Papper):**
    - Convention based
    - High performance
    - Lacks in documentation
- **[BCCAutoMapperBundle](https://github.com/michelsalib/BCCAutoMapperBundle):**
    - Only available as a Symfony bundle (<3.0)
    - Very similar to this project
    - Does some cool stuff with graph mapping

Note that using a custom mapper is very fast. So when performance really starts
to matter in your application, you can easily [implement a custom mapper](#using-a-custom-mapper)
where needed, without needing to change the code that uses the mapper.

## A note on PHPStan

Because of an issue described [here](https://github.com/mark-gerarts/phpstan-automapper-plus),
PHPStan reports the following error if you use the `$context` parameter:

```
Method AutoMapperPlus\MapperInterface::map() invoked with 3 parameters, 2 required.
```

If you see this error, you should enable the [AutoMapper+ extension](https://github.com/mark-gerarts/phpstan-automapper-plus).
Please note that this is a temporary solution. The issue will be fixed in the
2.0 release.

- [x] Allow mapping from `stdClass`,
- [x] or perhaps even an associative array (could have)
- [x] Allow mapping to `stdClass`
- [x] Provide options to copy a mapping

- [ ] Clean up the property checking in the Mapping::forMember() method.
- [ ] Refactor tests
- [ ] Allow setting a maximum depth, see #14
- [ ] Provide a NameResolver that accepts an array mapping, as an alternative to multiple `FromProperty`s
- [ ] Make use of a decorated Symfony's `PropertyAccessor` (see [#16](https://github.com/mark-gerarts/automapper-plus/issues/16))
- [x] Allow adding of middleware to the mapper
- [ ] Allow mapping *to* array

*[Version 2](https://github.com/mark-gerarts/automapper-plus/tree/2.0) is in the works, check there for new features as well*
